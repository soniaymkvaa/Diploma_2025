# Diploma_2025
code and description of the code for diploma project

file sofiia_diploma_flights_final.xlsx - file with syntetical data.
This repository contains 3 .ipynb files, which implement Hierarchical Clustering, KMeans and GMM, perform data preparation, derivation of cluster characteristics, and visualization of them and financial indicators distributed across clusters. All files were runned with the real data, so the results(tables, plots, etc.) in it will be different from those you will have after running code with the syntetical data I provided.

For visualization of tables the ace_tools_open library from this source was used: github.com/zinccat/ace_tools_open.git

to use it, please run the command ``pip install git+https://github.com/zinccat/ace_tools_open.git in the terminal``
